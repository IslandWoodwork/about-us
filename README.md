# 😎 About myself
Hey! My name is Andrew Gottilla. I created this GitHub account. I've been working on a project that would greatly benefit us to utilize GitHub. My goal is to have our company's future programming projects managed using this platform.

I graduated from Farmingdale State College with a degree in Computer Programming and Information Systems in 2018. Before attending Farmingdale State, I attended Nassau Community College and graduated with an Information Technology degree in 2016.

- 👀 I’m interested in developing more projects and learning new systems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning much about web application development and project management
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others who I can learn
