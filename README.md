# 😎 About myself
Hey! My name is Andrew Gottilla. I created this GitHub account. I've been working on a project that would greatly benefit our company to utilize GitHub. My goal is to have our company's future programming projects managed using this platform.

In 2018, I graduated from Farmingdale State College with a B.S. in Computer Programming and Information Systems. Before attending Farmingdale State, I attended Nassau Community College and graduated with an A.A.S in Information Technology.

- 👀 I’m interested in developing more projects and learning new systems of software development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning much about web application development and project management
- 💞️ I’m looking to continue collaborating with people that I can learn from
