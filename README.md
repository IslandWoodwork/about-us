# hello-world
First repository

Yo! My name is Andrew Gottilla. I'm creating this GitHub account to showcase the project that I've spent just over a month working on.

I graduated from Farmingdale State College with a degree in Computer Programming and Information Systems in 2018. Before attending Farmingdale State, I attended Nassau Community College and graduated with an Information Technology degree in 2016.
